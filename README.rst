Django Feedback is a simple Django application that makes it trivialto start accepting user feedback 
from authenticated users within your Django project.

Installation
============

Put ``feedback`` in your ``INSTALLED_APPS``, and set ``FEEDBACK_CHOICES`` to a 2-tuple of feedback types
in your settings file. For example::

	FEEDBACK_CHOICES = (
		('bug', 'Bug'),
		('feature_request', 'Feature Request')
	)
	
Also, be sure to include ``feedback.urls`` somewhere in your urls.py file.

Add ``feedback.context_processors.feedback_form`` to ``TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS``, and
``feedback_form`` will be in the context for all authenticated users.
